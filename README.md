# hello-world
hello to my first repository.
My name is Fiyin
I am a medical doctor, in my late 30s.
I have always been interested in data, and am finally taking the step of faith to pursue my passion.
I am on a journey to becoming a data science with a special interest in bioinformatics (for now).
Watch me grow as a data scientist!!!!
Watch me make sense of and bring to life the data generated around me
